### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a motivated and versatile professional with over 5 years of experience in sales, customer service, and technical support across Bulgaria, Europe, and the United States. My strong interpersonal and problem-solving skills, combined with a solid technical background, allow me to deliver effective solutions and exceptional client experiences.

I have solid experience working with various computer software and internet tools, including office suites and technical maintenance of computer equipment and systems, which enables me to provide reliable IT support.

My language skills include fluency in English (written and spoken), and proficiency in German (A1-A2 level, certified), alongside basic knowledge of Arabic and Turkish. I continuously seek opportunities to improve and practice these skills.

Academically, I hold a certificate in "Small and Medium Business" from the Federation of Scientific and Technical Unions in Sofia, providing me with a strong foundation in business management, marketing, financial analysis, and consulting. Additionally, I completed a certified "Digital Marketing" course by Google, enhancing my ability to design and implement effective marketing strategies.

Currently, I am advancing my technical expertise by pursuing the [**Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity), preparing me for roles such as cybersecurity analyst, IT security analyst, Cyber defense analyst, Information security analyst and Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. More information about the certification course you can learn [here](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity) and [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity).

Following this training, I plan to further expand my knowledge in cybersecurity by preparing for the **CompTIA Security+** certification — a globally recognized credential that validates baseline skills in network security, threat detection and response, risk management, and compliance. This will help me build a strong, industry-acknowledged foundation for a career in information security.

Additionally, I am engaging with hands-on cybersecurity training through platforms like **TryHackMe**, which provides practical, scenario-based labs for developing real-world offensive and defensive security skills.

In addition to cybersecurity, I have a strong interest in **Digital Marketing and Brand Management**. I plan to enroll in a course at the **London School of Public Relations** that focuses on developing practical skills in brand management and employer branding.  

The course emphasizes strategic brand development aimed at enhancing customer experience and brand value. It covers modern marketing topics including social media influence, influencer marketing, and the use of artificial intelligence in brand communications.  

Participants explore the entire brand development process—from positioning and mission to stakeholder engagement and extending brand lifespan—supported by real-world business cases from diverse industries. The program is tailored for marketing specialists, employer branding managers, HR and communication professionals, preparing them to face current challenges with proven strategies.

I am adaptable, quick to learn new tasks, and comfortable working in diverse, dynamic environments. My international experience has further strengthened my communication skills and cultural awareness, allowing me to maintain ethical and tolerant interpersonal relations. I am disciplined, responsible, and effective both independently and as part of a team.

## 🤝 Public Causes & Charity Involvement

I actively participate in social and charitable initiatives that reflect my values and sense of responsibility toward the community. Here are some of the causes I’ve supported or initiated:

### 🌍 Sunay Sabriev |  "752 Books for Chitalishte 'Prosveta' in Glodzhevo (Community Cultural Center)" - Donation Campaign 
**Role:** Organizer

**Description:** In late 2020, I initiated a nationwide book donation campaign titled "752 Books for Chitalishte 'Prosveta' in Glodzhevo (Community Cultural Center)" - with the goal of collecting 752 books for the underfunded community library in the town of Glodzhevo, Bulgaria. What began as a modest idea quickly grew into a powerful collective movement. Thanks to the overwhelming support from citizens across the country—including individuals who personally traveled to Ruse to donate in person—the campaign exceeded all expectations, gathering nearly 1,800 books.

The initiative received official support from the Municipality of Ruse, with the Mayor of Ruse, Mr. Pencho Milkov, personally participating in the effort. With the municipality's help, books were successfully delivered to the community centers in Glodzhevo and the nearby village of Shtarklevo.

This campaign stands as an example of how one idea, when fueled by determination and community spirit, can grow into a movement that connects people from all walks of life. It taught me that with courage and consistency, meaningful change is always possible.
